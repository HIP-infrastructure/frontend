# HIP Frontend
## Meta package for NextCloud, HIP web app and gateway API
This is the install for the HIP frontend

Includes 
- Nextcloud install [nextcloud-docker](https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/nextcloud-docker)
- Nextcloud HIP app [hip](https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/hip)
- HIP Gateway [gateway](https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/gateway)
- https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/bids-converter
- https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/nextcloud-social-login

The install is based on make and git submodules.
As the package will migrate to K8s, everything is build on the host 

### Prerequisite
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Make sure you have [docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04) and docker-compose installed
- Install `make`: `sudo apt install build-essential`

## Deploy, production
- Clone this repo, `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/frontend.git`
- `cd frontend`
- `git checkout master`. You can checkout any branch, and submodules, like dev `make update branch=dev`
- Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and edit the variables according to your needs.
- if you are installing with make install, NODE_ENV=production, with make dev-install NODE_ENV=developement
- If on a local domain, add a choosen local domain name to your `/etc/hosts`
  - your_ip   hip.local

### First time install 

#### Nextcloud

`cp nextcloud-docker/Caddyfile.template caddy/Caddyfile`
- Edit and add your domain name

Create a folder named secrets and add the following txt files to `nextcloud-docker/secrets` :
- nextcloud_admin_password.txt # put admin password to this file
- nextcloud_admin_user.txt # put admin username to this file
- postgres_db.txt # put postgresql db name to this file
- postgres_password.txt # put postgresql password to this file
- postgres_user.txt # put postgresql username to this file

- `make install` Nextcloud will fail. Don't bother
- Once Nextcloud is installed, we need to replace the created php-settings by our own in order to parametrize it for docker etc.
  - `sudo rm -rf /mnt/nextcloud-dp/php-settings`
  - `sudo cp -r php-settings /mnt/nextcloud-dp`

- `make install` It will fail, again. 
  - `make occ c=maintenance:install`
  - The new NC install asks fo a password for admin, use the one provided in secrets in [nextcloud_admin_password.txt]

- Add some params to the Nextcloud php config in  `/mnt/nextcloud-dp/nextcloud/config/config.php`
    ```
    'htaccess.RewriteBase' => '/',    
    'htaccess.IgnoreFrontController' => true,     
    'defaultapp' => 'hip'  
    ```  

  if you are local instance with self-signe SSL, add
```
  'trusted_domains' => ['hip.local'],

```
- `make install` again
- Open your browser to your ip or hostname
- Access NextCloud with admin/[nextcloud_admin_password.txt]

#### Social-login app, OIDC client, groups
Social login is a Nextcloud app, customized for our need, helping the OIDC login process for users.

- With the current Keycloak setup, you need an EBRAINS account. 
  - Either on production https://iam.ebrains.eu/register or development, https://[iam-provider-url]/register
- Center will be mapped to EBRAINS keycloak groups, we will need to add you there manually on EBRAINS for authorization purposes.
- Create a group for your Center via the NC api.
  - `make occ c="group:add  --display-name CHUV chuv"`

- Open settings under you profile, on the top right.
- Choose "Social Login" under the administration menu, in the left sidebar  
  - [x] Update user profile every login
  - [x] Hide default login
  - [x] Button text without prefix


- Add a Custom OpenID Connect client.
