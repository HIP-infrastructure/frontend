# HIP Frontend

## Meta package for NextCloud, HIP web app and gateway API
This is the install for the HIP frontend

Includes

- Nextcloud install [nextcloud-docker](https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/nextcloud-docker)
- Nextcloud HIP app [hip](https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/hip)
- HIP Gateway [gateway](https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/gateway)
- https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/bids-converter
- https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/nextcloud-social-login


The install is based on make and git submodules.
As the package will migrate to K8s, everything is build on the host

### Prerequisite

- Ubuntu 22.04
- A Keycloak instance
  - as in https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/keycloak
  - as well as the collab backend `install_keycloak_backend.sh`
- Nextcloud 24.0.x installed, as in [Nextcloud install](https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/nextcloud-docker)
- Configured Nextcloud for the HIP: [NextcloudConfig.md)](NextcloudConfig.md)

## Deploy, production

- Clone this repo, `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/frontend.git`
- `cd frontend`
- `git checkout master`
- You can checkout the submodules to the desired branch, default is the latest version
- Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and edit the variables according to your needs.

### First time install

- install all the dependencies by calling
- `./hip-required_ubuntu-22.04.sh`
- You might want to logout and login again, in order to gain access to the docker command for your current user

#### GhostFS

- a distributed file system tailored to the HIP
- `make install-ghostfs`
- You will need to provide a user/password for the server, that you will need to install on the [backend](https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/app-in-browser#configuring-app-in-browser))
- pm2 cannot start ghostfs at this time, as Nextcloud data storage doesn't exist yet. A pm2 error for the service is ok at this time.

#### Nextcloud

if you want to migrate an existing install to a new location, here are a few tips [Nextcloud-migration.md](https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/frontend/blob/master/Nextcloud-Migration.md)

Create a folder named secrets and add the following txt files to `nextcloud-docker/secrets` :
- nextcloud_admin_password.txt # put admin password to this file
- nextcloud_admin_user.txt # put admin username to this file
- postgres_db.txt # put postgresql db name to this file
- postgres_password.txt # put postgresql password to this file
- postgres_user.txt # put postgresql username to this file

- `make install-nextcloud` Nextcloud will fail. Don't bother
- Once Nextcloud is installed, we need to replace the created php-settings by our own in order to parametrize it for docker etc.
  - `sudo rm -rf /mnt/nextcloud-dp/php-settings`
  - `sudo cp -r php-settings /mnt/nextcloud-dp`

- `make install-nextcloud` It will fail, again. 
  - `make occ c=maintenance:install`
  - Nextcloud install asks fo a password for admin, use the one provided in secrets in [nextcloud_admin_password.txt]

- Add some params to the Nextcloud php config in  `/mnt/nextcloud-dp/nextcloud/config/config.php`
```
    'htaccess.RewriteBase' => '/',
    'htaccess.IgnoreFrontController' => true,
    'defaultapp' => 'hip',
    'trusted_domains' => ['hip.local'],
```
- `make install`
- Open your browser to your ip or hostname
- Access NextCloud with admin/[nextcloud_admin_password.txt]
- NextCloud could complain about Access through untrusted domain, and in that case, re-add your domain to the `/mnt/nextcloud-dp/nextcloud/config/config.php` file again. This yhould fix it.
- sudo pm2 restart all to restart ghostfs

#### Social-login app, OIDC client, groups
Social login is a Nextcloud app, customized for our need, helping the OIDC login process for users.

- With the current Keycloak setup, you need an EBRAINS account. 
  - Either on production https://iam.ebrains.eu/register or development, https://[iam-provider-url]/register
- Center will be mapped to EBRAINS keycloak groups, we will need to add you there manually on EBRAINS for authorization purposes.
- Create a group for your Center via the NC api.
  - `make occ c="group:add  --display-name CHUV chuv"`

- Open settings under you profile, on the top right.
- Choose "Social Login" under the administration menu, in the left sidebar  
  - [x] Update user profile every login
  - [x] Hide default login
  - [x] Button text without prefix


- Add a Custom OpenID Connect client.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Internal name | dev.thehip.app |
| Title | EBRAINS-INT |
| Authorize url | https://[iam-provider-url]/auth/realms/hbp/protocol/openid-connect/auth |
| Token url | https://[iam-provider-url]/auth/realms/hbp/protocol/openid-connect/token |
| Display name claim (optional) | name |
| Username claim (optional) | preferred_username |
| User info URL (optional) | https://[iam-provider-url]/auth/realms/hbp/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo | 
| Client Id | [iam-client_id] | 
| Client Secret | [iam-client_secret] |
| Scope | openid group profile email roles team | 
| Groups claim (optional) | roles.group |

Add group mapping 

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| group-HIP-dev-CHUV | chuv | 

Save everything, logout, and try to login with your EBBRAINS credentials

## Deploy, dev

Change the NODE_ENV to development in the .env file

`make dev-install`

deploy/reload gateway
`make dev-install-gateway`
